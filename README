Lab 1 Submission README
=======================
by James Danylik, UID 403548957

The lab submission follows the same directory structure and makefile layout as
the skelton project.  To compile, simply use make in the root directory of the
project, which will use the Makefile in ./src to compile executibles into ./bin.

Additionnally, since my report is in latex and SEASnet supports the format, I've
also added an additional target to the makefile to rebuild the accompanying
report.  Since I can't be certain this will indeed be run in an environment with
latex during the grading, I've included a copy of the resultant pdf; the make
rule is left as a novelty.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
Also, due to the confusion over turn in and where the binaries need to build to
to survive automatic grading, I've included a perfectly superflous script
aliasing src/dwt3d to run.sh and passing all arguments straight thru.  PLEASE DO
NOT USE IT UNLESS NECCASARY; I am not sure if the extra overhead will effect
measurement or not, and I'd like to avoid it unless the automated grading
requires it.
