Lab 1 Submission README
=======================
by James Danylik, UID 403548957

The lab submission follows the same directory structure and makefile layout as
the skelton project.  To compile, simply use make in the root directory of the
project, which will use the Makefile in ./src to compile executibles into ./bin.

Additionnally, since my report is in latex and SEASnet supports the format, I've
also added an additional target to the makefile to rebuild the accompanying
report.  Since I can't be certain this will indeed be run in an environment with
latex during the grading, I've included a copy of the resultant pdf; the make
rule is left as a novelty.
